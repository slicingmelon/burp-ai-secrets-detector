HTTP Handler Example Extension
============================

###### Demonstrates performing various actions on requests passing through any tool in Burp

 ---

The extension works as follows:
- It registers an HTTP handler
- For outgoing request messages:
    - If the request is a `POST` request:
        - The body of the request is logged to output
        - A comment is added to the request
    - A URL parameter is added to the request
- For incoming response messages:
    - If the corresponding request contained a `Content-Length` header, a `BLUE` highlight is added
